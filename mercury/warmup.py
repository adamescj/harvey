"""Inbox warm-up: health gates on top of the mailbox ramp, a week-by-week
plan for new inboxes, and DNS authentication checks.

What warm-up means here (and what it doesn't): Mercury does not run a
"warm-up network" that trades fake emails with other inboxes. It does the
parts that actually move reputation for a new mailbox — authenticate the
domain, start small, ramp slowly, stop when bounces climb.

Single source of truth: which inboxes exist, their daily caps and their ramp
come from ``channels.email.mailboxes`` in mercury.yaml (``warmup_start``,
``warmup_initial_cap``, ``warmup_weekly_increase``), through
``mercury.integrations.mailboxes.MailboxPool``. Without a mailboxes list the
pool is the one configured inbox, capped by ``max_daily_sends``, no ramp.

This module adds what the config can't know, kept in the ``warmup_inboxes``
table as an overlay keyed by mailbox address:

* **Health gate**, per mailbox, over the last 7 days (or since the last
  manual resume, if later). Sends are that mailbox's outreach sends; bounces
  are attributed through the outbox row they bounced (or the inbox the DSN
  arrived in).

    fewer than 20 sends          → ok ("not enough sends yet")
    bounce rate > 5%             → pause: the mailbox flips to ``paused`` and
                                   stays there until a human resumes it
    3% < bounce rate ≤ 5%        → hold: today's cap is yesterday's ramp cap
    otherwise                    → ok

* **Manual pause** from the dashboard (cap 0 until resumed).
* The **checklist** and free-form **notes**.

Enforcement: ``apply_health`` fills ``MailboxPool.gates`` and the pool's
``cap_on`` applies them, so the sender, the Outbox capacity card and this
page compute the same caps with the same rolling-24-hour counts. A paused
mailbox sends no cold email (openers or follow-ups are held, not cancelled);
replies to people who wrote back still go out, as with the ramp, bounded only
by ``max_daily_sends``. A gate can only ever lower a cap.
