"""Sender — deploys campaigns via Instantly, or sends natively via the
configured mail provider (Gmail / SMTP) through the outbox approval ladder.

Native flow:
  1. Draft campaigns are STAGED: merge variables rendered per prospect,
     one outbox row per (prospect, step) with a scheduled send_at.
     Rows start as pending_review (copilot) or approved (autopilot).
  2. Each heartbeat DRAINS due approved rows: kill-switch check, stop-on-
     reply check, deterministic pre-send gate, then provider.send_email
     with jittered pacing and the daily cap.
