# Configuration

Mercury reads two kinds of configuration: a YAML file that describes what you sell, who you sell to and how Mercury behaves, and environment variables (usually a `.env` file) that hold credentials. This page explains which YAML file is used, lists every key with its default, lists every environment variable, and shows how to change Mercury's voice through `prompts/` and `skills/`. Defaults below are taken from `mercury/config.py`.

## Which config file is used

Mercury looks for its YAML config in this order and uses the first one that exists:

1. The file named by the `MERCURY_CONFIG` environment variable. If it is set but the file does not exist, Mercury stops with an error rather than falling back.
2. `mercury.local.yaml` in the current directory, then in the project root.
3. `mercury.yaml` in the current directory, its parent, then the project root.

| File | Tracked in git | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `mercury.yaml` | yes | An untrained template. Leave it generic in a public fork. |
| `mercury.local.yaml` | no (gitignored) | Your real configuration. `mercury train` writes this file. |
| `MERCURY_CONFIG=/path/file.yaml` | n/a | Point at any file explicitly, e.g. a demo config or a per-environment config. |

The split exists so a public checkout can run a private business configuration without ever committing your positioning, pricing or targeting.

Errors are reported by field, for example `channels.email.max_daily_sends: must be >= 0`. Mercury will not start with an invalid config.

Most settings are read when a process starts. After editing the YAML, restart `mercury run` and the dashboard. Skills and prompts are the exception: they are read from disk on each use.

## YAML reference

### `persona`

Who the emails come from. All fields are required.

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Sender's display name. Also the default From name for each mailbox. |
| `company` | Your company name. Appears in the compliance footer. If it is still `Your Company`, `mercury run` treats Mercury as unconfigured and opens the setup wizard. |
| `role` | Sender's role, used in prompts. |
| `email` | Sender address. With a single SMTP mailbox it is the From address; with rotation it identifies which mailbox owns threads started before rotation. |
| `linkedin` | LinkedIn profile URL, used in prompts. |
| `tone` | Free text, e.g. `professional, consultative, confident`. |

### `product`

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | | Product or service name. |
| `description` | yes | | One or two sentences. |
| `pricing` | yes | | Free text. |
| `key_benefits` | yes | | List of strings. |
| `objection_responses` | yes | | Map of objection to response, e.g. `"too expensive": "..."`. May be `{}`. |
| `offer` | no | see below | What the outreach is trying to get. |

`product.offer`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `primary` | `""` | Main offer, e.g. `Monthly plan from $99/mo`. |
| `entry` | `""` | Low-commitment entry, e.g. `Free audit`. |
| `goal` | `book_call` | `book_call`, `start_trial` or `get_reply`. |
| `booking_method` | `calendar_link` | `calendar_link`, `suggest_times` or `ask_preference`. |
| `booking_url` | `""` | Calendar link, used with `calendar_link`. |
| `meeting_duration` | `15 minutes` | Free text. |
| `meeting_owner` | `""` | Who takes the meeting. |

### `icp`

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `industries` | yes | | List. Discovery searches each industry in each place. |
| `company_size` | yes | | Free text, e.g. `10-200 employees`. |
| `titles` | yes | | Target job titles. |
| `geography` | yes | | List of places, e.g. `"Denver, CO"`. Discovery uses these as cities. |
| `hiring_signals` | no | `[]` | Role keywords that mean a company is buying now (careers pages, job boards). Empty falls back to `titles`. |
| `geo_coordinates` | no | `{}` | Maps a `geography` entry to `"lat,lng,radius_km"`. Listings providers search a radius, not a name. Cities without an entry are geocoded once through OpenStreetMap Nominatim and cached. |
| `markets` | no | `[]` | Market-aware discovery: each market searches its own terms in its own places and language. When set, discovery uses markets instead of `industries` x `geography`. |

Each entry in `markets`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | required | Label. |
| `places` | required | List of places. |
| `terms` | required | Search terms used in those places. |
| `lang` | `en` | Language hint for providers that localise results. |

```yaml
icp:
  industries: ["Roofing contractor", "HVAC contractor"]
  company_size: "5-50 employees"
  titles: ["Owner", "General Manager"]
  geography: ["Denver, CO", "Boulder, CO"]
  geo_coordinates:
    "Denver, CO": "39.7392,-104.9903,50"
  markets:
    - name: "Colorado"
      places: ["Denver, CO", "Boulder, CO"]
      terms: ["roofing contractor", "hvac contractor"]
      lang: "en"
```

### `channels.email`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Set `false` to stop the sender entirely. |
| `provider` | `instantly` | `gmail`, `smtp` or `instantly`. The tracked template sets `gmail`; the code default and the trainer's output are `instantly`, so set this explicitly. |
| `max_daily_sends` | `50` | Hard cap on all native sends (first emails, follow-ups and replies) in a rolling 24 hours. On Instantly, the number of leads added per day. |
| `send_to_risky` | `false` | Also send to `risky` (catch-all) addresses. Off means verified addresses only. |
| `require_approval` | `true` | Native providers: every outgoing email, including replies, waits in the outbox until approved. |
| `max_bounce_rate` | `0.05` | Global kill switch threshold. `0` disables it. See [Bounces](email-and-deliverability.md#bounces-and-the-kill-switch). |
| `mailboxes` | `[]` | SMTP only: rotate sends across several mailboxes. Empty uses the single `SMTP_*` mailbox. Ignored (with a warning) for other providers. |
| `warmup_initial_cap` | `5` | Day-one cap for a mailbox with a `warmup_start`. |
| `warmup_weekly_increase` | `5` | Added to the cap every 7 days, up to the mailbox's `daily_cap`. |
| `auto_approve_followups` | `false` | With approval on, approving a first email also approves its follow-ups. Replies still need approval. |
| `spread_sends` | `false` | Pace the day's remaining cold sends evenly over the cycles left before quiet hours, instead of up to 8 per cycle. |

Each entry in `mailboxes`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | required | Sending address. Lowercased; must be unique in the list. |
| `name` | `""` | From display name. Empty uses `persona.name`. |
| `username` | `""` | SMTP/IMAP login. Empty uses `email`. |
| `password_env` | `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Name of the environment variable holding this mailbox's password. Must be a `MAILBOX_*` variable, `SMTP_PASSWORD` or `IMAP_PASSWORD`. Passwords never go in YAML. |
| `smtp_host` | `""` | Empty uses `SMTP_HOST`. |
| `smtp_port` | `0` | `0` uses `SMTP_PORT`. |
| `imap_host` | `""` | Empty uses `IMAP_HOST`, then the SMTP host. |
| `imap_port` | `0` | `0` uses `IMAP_PORT`. |
| `daily_cap` | `30` | Steady-state ceiling once warm-up is done. Must be >= 0. |
| `warmup_start` | none | First day this mailbox sends cold mail (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Omit for an already-warm mailbox. A future date means it sends nothing until then. |
| `enabled` | `true` | `false`: start no new threads here, but keep reading its inbox and finishing its existing threads. |

How rotation, warm-up and health gates use these is covered in [Email and deliverability](email-and-deliverability.md#mailbox-rotation).

### `channels.linkedin`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | LinkedIn prospecting only runs when this is true and `LINKEDIN_EMAIL` is set. |
| `max_daily_connections` | `20` | |
| `max_daily_messages` | `10` | |

### `usage`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_daily_claude_percent` | `80` | Stop model work when either Claude quota window (5-hour or weekly) reaches this utilization. Must be in (0, 100]. When the quota can't be read, Mercury falls back to its own call count, capped at 200 x this percent (160 calls a day by default). |
| `heartbeat_interval_minutes` | `15` | Sleep between cycles. Minimum 1. |
| `quiet_hours.start` | `22:00` | 24h `HH:MM`. |
| `quiet_hours.end` | `07:00` | Ranges may cross midnight. |
| `quiet_hours.timezone` | `America/New_York` | IANA name. Also defines "today" for mailbox warm-up days. |

During quiet hours the loop sleeps: no sending, no inbox polling, no discovery. `mercury run --once` skips the cycle unless you pass `--ignore-quiet-hours`.

### `compliance`

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `postal_address` | `""` | Physical postal address for the footer. **The native sender holds the outbox while this is empty.** |
| `opt_out_line_en` | `Not relevant? Reply "unsubscribe" and you won't hear from me again.` | English opt-out line. |
| `opt_out_line_es` | `¿No es para ti? Responde "baja" y no te escribo más.` | Spanish opt-out line, used when the email body reads as Spanish. |

The opt-out lines also help the reply handler strip Mercury's own quoted text out of inbound replies, so keep them distinctive. See [Compliance](email-and-deliverability.md#compliance-footer-and-opt-outs).

## Environment variables (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Mercury loads the project's `.env` into the process environment (variables already set in the environment win), so a container or a scheduled job can inject the same variables without a file. `.env` is gitignored.

### Email provider (pick one)

| Variable | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` | | Gmail API OAuth client (type "Desktop app"). Then run `mercury gmail auth`. |
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` | | |
| `SMTP_HOST` | | SMTP server. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | STARTTLS on 587; implicit TLS on 465. |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | | Login, and the From address fallback for a single mailbox. |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | | |
| `IMAP_HOST` | `SMTP_HOST` | Where replies and bounces are read (IMAP over TLS). |
| `IMAP_PORT` | `993` | |
| `IMAP_USERNAME` | `SMTP_USERNAME` | |
| `IMAP_PASSWORD` | `SMTP_PASSWORD` | |
| `MAILBOX_*` | | Any variable starting with `MAILBOX_` can hold a rotation mailbox's password, named by `password_env`, e.g. `MAILBOX_ALEX_PASSWORD`. |
| `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` | | Legacy Instantly provider. Requires Instantly's Growth plan or higher. |

### Email verification (add at least one)

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `REOON_API_KEY` | Main verifier. Free monthly allowance. Also used to size the inbox sweep to the credits you have left. |
| `ZEROBOUNCE_API_KEY` | Tried first for Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 domains. |
| `HUNTER_API_KEY` | Email-pattern lookup (domain search) and a fallback verifier. |
| `TREG_TOKEN` | Optional. treg.to prepaid balance; when set, the inbox sweep verifies through it before Reoon. Not in `.env.example`. |

### Discovery and search

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` / `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` | DataForSEO Business Listings and SERP providers. The API password is generated in their dashboard; it is not your account password. |
| `DATAFORSEO_SANDBOX` | Any value routes DataForSEO calls to their free sandbox (dummy data, never charged). |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | Serper discovery provider, and the first backend for Scout's web searches. Close to mandatory from a datacenter IP. |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Optional second search backend for Scout, tried after Serper. Not in `.env.example`. |
| `SEMRUSH_API_KEY` | Semrush competitors discovery provider. Not in `.env.example`. |
| `GMAPS_SCRAPER_URL` | Base URL of a self-hosted google-maps-scraper for the `google_maps` provider. Default `http://127.0.0.1:8085`. |

### Other integrations

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `LINKEDIN_EMAIL` / `LINKEDIN_PASSWORD` | Optional browser-automation prospecting. Automating LinkedIn violates its terms; use an account you can afford to lose. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Optional JS-rendered crawling during `mercury train` (token needs "Browser Rendering: Edit"). Without them the trainer uses a plain HTTP crawler. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Where the Claude CLI keeps its credentials. Mercury reads the OAuth token from here for the quota gauge. Default `~/.claude`. |

### Runtime overrides

| Variable | Read by | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MERCURY_CONFIG` | everything | Explicit config file path (see above). |
| `MERCURY_DB_PATH` | the dashboard only | Point the dashboard at another SQLite file, e.g. the demo database. `mercury run` and the other CLI commands always use `data/mercury.db`. |
| `MERCURY_STATE_REPO` | `scripts/cloud_run.sh`, `scripts/local_dashboard.sh` | URL of the private state repository for scheduled cloud runs. `HARVEY_STATE_REPO` is still read when it is unset. See [Cloud runs](cloud.md). |

`bash scripts/check_env.sh` prints which of the cloud-run variables are set, without network calls or printing secrets.

The dashboard's Settings tab can write most credentials into `.env` for you. It shows only whether a secret is set, never its value.

## Customizing what Mercury says

Both directories are plain Markdown, read from disk each time they are used. Edits take effect on the next call; no restart needed.

### `prompts/`

| File | Used by |
|---|---|
| `system.md` | Shared system instructions. |
| `scout.md` | Scoring and personalizing found prospects. |
| `writer.md` | Writing sequences: structure, length, banned phrases, spam rules. |
| `handler.md` | Classifying and answering replies. |

Templates use `{{variable}}` placeholders. Mercury logs a warning if a placeholder is left unfilled.

### `skills/`

Skills are knowledge files injected into an agent's prompt. The mapping lives in `load_skills_for_agent` in `mercury/brain.py`:

| Agent | Skills |
|---|---|
| Scout | `prospecting_tactics`, `lead_qualification`, `account_navigation`, `signal_playbook`, `product_knowledge` |
| Writer | `email_frameworks`, `signal_playbook`, `sales_methodology`, `offer_strategy`, `product_knowledge`, `competitive_intel` |
| Handler | `objection_handling`, `sales_methodology`, `offer_strategy`, `product_knowledge`, `competitive_intel` |
| Sender | `email_frameworks`, `product_knowledge` |
| LinkedIn | `linkedin_outreach`, `prospecting_tactics`, `product_knowledge` |

`product_knowledge.md` and `competitive_intel.md` are generated by `mercury train` and gitignored. To add a new skill, create the file and add its name to the map in `brain.py`. `skills/README.md` describes each built-in skill.

Prompts are instructions, not guarantees. The [pre-send gate](email-and-deliverability.md#the-pre-send-gate) enforces the hard rules (length, links, banned phrases, merge tags) in code no matter what a prompt says.
